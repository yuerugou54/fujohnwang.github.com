<p>Nowadays, we have many buzzwords, like, ‘Event-driven X’, ‘Data-driven X’, but I am an <strong>Interest-driven</strong> fellow, and I don’t want to change what I am.</p>
<p>They say, ‘I have loan to repay, I have .., I can’t be driven by my interests anymore’;</p>
<p>I say<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, ‘fuck it, I will keep on being driven by my interests’</p>
<p>In other words, <strong>Follow your heart</strong>, and that’s why I have given up some things they have, and I don’t regret.</p>

<p>I have a friend, a guy who is not like a technician although he still is, he like money very much and have a good sense on it, he tried all of the ways he can find to earn money and is still trying, and money is his goal (but I don’t know whether it’s his destination). I LIKE money too (we all do and we all need it, right?), but I don’t think I will live for it only, I don’t know how to spend money<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and don’t have a strong desire to set it as my goal to chase, I always think I am chasing some ultimate knowledge status, maybe Wisdom it is.</p>
<p>When I was young, my family was poor, I worked hard to earn more money, and I hope my parents can be happy and don’t have to work hard anymore, that’s my goal those years; These years, I have been thinking and seeking a new goal, ’cause earning salaries becomes meaningless. It’s a mental hell I have struggled in for a long time.</p>
<p>The early-3-year working experiences in alibaba made me look like more geek<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, and benefited me to be promoted to Senior Technology Expert position, I appreciated this experience, because I knew I did throw myself deeply into the world of technology and academia. But the turning point comes, I fell off the cliff<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> to ‘zero’, frustrated， mixed-up, luckily, I pulled myself together finally, and joined TMALL then found a new world.</p>
<p>I knew more things besides technology here at tmall, people, product, marketing, internet things, commercial things, enterprise things, I watch, I think, I learn…</p>
<p>But my friends, I had a dream in my deep heart, and I never give it up, I can’t wait anymore. I have to explore new ways to challenge myself, and on ‘<strong>Battlestar Alibaba</strong>’, I don’t think I can find one, no match, that’s why I choose to leave to look for a sailing boat (or build one), not a ship, even more an aircraft carrier, ’cause I like sailing more than just steady seats.</p>
<p>My new goal involves money things, but I think the dream to chase some wisdom is the key point and money should be one of the derivatives.</p>
<p>I have deposited too much, it’s time to let it out！</p>
<p>BTW, I had always been had a illusion<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, that’s, my CODE number in alibaba always makes me think the curve will match the path, ok, it does in my opinion, <strong>28082</strong>, rise steeply and fall deeply, then rise and fall again… Anyway, A happy ending I think, ；）</p>
<p>Cross your fingers for me, my friends…</p>
