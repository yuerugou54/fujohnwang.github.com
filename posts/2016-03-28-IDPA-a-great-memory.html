<p>I have to say I had not expected to have such a great experience when I booked the ticket and flew to Bangkok last week. When the IDPA training finished, I felt so fucking great, and that's why I have to write it down here, do U want to know more? read on...</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Shooter Ready, Standby...</strong>&quot;</p>

<h1 id="i-met-wonderful-people"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> I Met Wonderful People</h1>
<p>here R we, the new F4, HAHA</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/F4.jpg" />

</div>
<p>Alley and I are from HangZhou, Zhejiang Province;</p>
<p>Zen and Karry are from ChangZhou, Jiangsu Province.</p>
<p>We got together in Bangkok.</p>
<p>We have so much fun in our class, that's all because we met such wonderful guys there...</p>
<h2 id="t.j."><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> T.J.</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/theeradej.jui">Theeradej Jui</a> <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> is our teacher. He is a funny guy,</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>but also a GREAT <strong>shooter</strong>, <strong>teacher</strong> and <strong>fucker</strong> ;)</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/TJ.JPG" />

</div>
<p>In our class, he shot 20 bullets in 19 seconds in a tac scenario without miss. He raise 61 snakes as pet, fed them once a week with rats, that's why I had thought it's the real reason that he can move so smoothly like a snake in the tac. In Chinese, we say “静若处子，动如脱兔”, I think it's talking about T.J.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Can U guess what he was talking about? ^_-</p>
</div>
<p>T.J. is a good teacher, a master.</p>
<p>I heard he taught the princess of Thailand, he taught the police officers, he taught army and SWAT, of course, he also teach ameteur like us.</p>
<p>He can figure out what goes wrong in your movements and help you fix it and improve it, he can make complicated thing be so easy to learn, that makes him a great teacher who can see the both sides of the mirror.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Squeeeeze.jpg" />

</div>
<p>In the above picture, I still can hear his voice after days: “<strong>Squeeeeeeze~</strong>”, &quot;慢~ 慢~ 来~&quot;(Take it easy and slow~)</p>
<p>T.J. talked a lot of &quot;黄段子&quot;（fucking jokes）， and said he is soooooo good in fucking , hahaha, I think it's true, so that's why I say he is a fucker ^_-</p>
<h2 id="leo"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Leo</h2>
<p>Leo is the organizer of IDPA China, he has 3 countries' passport: HK, Canada and England?(I can't remember for sure).</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>He is just 27 and has thought he wasted time in his earlier life, R u fucking with me, man? I am getting close to 40, but has just started to try everything, U R fucking so LUCKY!</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/try-everything.jpg" />

</div>
<p>Anyway，for me, it's <strong>Better late than Never</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="james-bond"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> James &amp; Bond</h2>
<p>Yeah, 007 is NOT one tough guy, but TWO.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/JAMES.BOND.JPG" />

</div>
<p>My friends, meet JAMES on my left and BOND on my right.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/JAMES.JPG" />

</div>
<p>JAMES is from Great Britain, before coming to Thailand, he had studied the Thai language. He came to Thailand 2 years ago and will stay, &quot;I love Thailand&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>JAMES gave me a lot of advices in our IDPA class.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/BOND.JPG" />

</div>
<p>BOND is a nice and friendly guy, it seems he met his friends everywhere.</p>
<p>BOND gave me a lot of advices in our IDPA class too.</p>
<h2 id="cai-hongfa"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Cai Hongfa</h2>
<p>Cai is still a mystery to me, but very nice and told me a lot of things and stories</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Cai-and-me.JPG" />

</div>
<p>He said I should write a book or just a preface of a book on Guns and IDPA thing, like the one below?</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/zen-of-moter.jpg" />

</div>
<p>Yeah, maybe next time I should ;)</p>
<h1 id="i-heard-great-stories"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> I Heard Great Stories</h1>
<h2 id="female-police-officer-of-hangzhou"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Female Police Officer Of HangZhou</h2>
<p>Yeah, just the city I'm staying.</p>
<p>Chinese police officers get equiped with pistols recently, but they don't receive proper training. One female police officer came home after shooting training without checking the gun whether it's empty and clear, pointed the gun to her husband, then the gun fired, lucky for her husband, but she got hurt deeply in heart and quit her job.</p>
<p>My friends, gun should be taken care of with caution, Safety First!</p>
<h2 id="cqb-and-japanese-teams"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> CQB and Japanese Teams</h2>
<p>When we are in our class, there are a CQB group and Japanese group in the neighbour, we had thought we are amateur, but when comparing with them, we knew we are NOT. ;)</p>
<h2 id="shoot-accurately-is-not-easy"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Shoot accurately is NOT easy</h2>
<p>We all watched movies with gunfire, and you maybe thought it's fucking ridiculous as I do that <code>it's so close, it can't miss</code>.</p>
<p>After the IDPA training, I will never say it's easy any more.</p>
<h1 id="i-felt-different-cultrue"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> I Felt Different Cultrue</h1>
<p>I can't tell it out exactly, but I feel warm in this country.</p>
<p>I think I will go Thailand again.</p>
